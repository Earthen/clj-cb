# clj-cb

A Clojure java-client wrapper for Couchbase Server 4. Now updated to support 6.0 with Couchbase Java client version 2.7.10. Simple N1QL query support has been added as well as basic N1QL prepared statement execution. Not all of the BNF-aware DSL clauses and expressions are yet supported. The unsupported clauses are JOIN, NEST, UNNEST, LET, UNION, INTERSECT and EXCEPT. Unsupported Expressions are add, between, concat, divide, exists, FALSE, in, is missing, is valued, MISSING, multiply, not between, not in, not like, NULL and subtract.

## Usage

```clojure
    (require '[earthen.clj-cb.cluster :as c]
                '[earthen.clj-cb.bucket :as b]
                '[earthen.clj-cb.bucket-manager :as bm])
    
    ;; we create the cluster
    (def cluster (c/create "localhost"))
    
    ;; we create a bucket
    (def bucket (c/open-bucket cluster "gamesim-sample"))

    ;; we authenticate with the bucket password, note: the password parameter on the c/bucket-open
    ;; no longer works and you will get the exception MixedAuthenticationException...
    ;; ...Mixed mode authentication not allowed, use Bucket credentials, User credentials (rbac) or Certificate auth


    (c/authenticate "gamesim-sample" "secret")
    
    ;; we get documents from bucket mapped
    (b/get bucket "Aaron1")
        => {:id "Aaron1", :cas 29856054464387, :expiry 0, :mutation-token nil, :content {:hitpoints 23832, :level 141, :loggedIn true, :name "Aaron1", :jsonType "player", :experience 248, :uuid "78edf902-7dd2-49a4-99b4-1c94ee286a33"}}

       ;; Parameters that you want to replace are passed in a Clojure map {"key" "value"}. Keys have to be "Strings" not
